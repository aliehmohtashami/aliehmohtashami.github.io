Data Visualization
	aims to communicate data clearly and effectively
	Pixel-Oriented Visualization technique
		a simple way to visualize the value of dimension 
		a m-dimension data, m windows created on screen

Measuring data similarity and dissimilarity (measure of proximity)
	to clustering, NN, outlier analysis we need compute similarity of two cases
	cluster
		collection of data 
		object in that collection are similar to theirselves
		unsimilar to other collection's object

	outlier analysis
		a clustering-based technique to choose objects dissimilar to others

	Nearest Neighbor
		a classification scheme where a given object is assigned a class label based on its similarity toward other objects in the model
